			<h3>History</h3>
			<h2><a href="#">Ed Schieffelin</a></h2>
			<div>
				<p>In 1877, there was a camp in southern Arizona, called Camp Huachuca, stationed there by the US government as an expedition to scout out the Chiricahua Apache Indians. Among this camp was a man named Ed Schiefflin, who was a prospector in search of ore.
					Through his propecting for rocks and ore, the town of Tombstone came to earn its name. Schieffelin was told by the soldiers in the camp,  "Ed, the only stone you will find out there will be your tombstone". 
					Ed found places no white man had seen or even prospected before. Eventually, sutmbling upon float ore, which are chunks that float off the main vein, near the hideout of the Apache Indians. His discovery eventually
					led to a huge southern Arizona silver strike that sprung up the town of Tombstone in 1879 in an area named Goose Flats, the closest flat land to the mines. AFter becoming a millionaire and having a family, he lusted to prospect again.
					Evetually he left the richeds behind and moved to a cabin in Oregon, where he found a gold mine. Ed was found dead in May of 1897, lunched over his work table with the gold ore he found being worked on. His last journal entry read,"Struck it rich again, by God."

			<h2><a href="#">Town of Tombstone</a></h2>
			<div>
				<p>During the silver strike, the towns population increased a couple hundered people to 4,000-5,000. This number was most likely only registered white male voters over 21 so the estimate with women, children, Chinese, & Mexican
				 immigrants would have been around 15 - 21,000. During the population boom the town blossomed into a very famous town for theatre. Two of the most famous are the Schieffelin Hall and Bird Cage Theatre. The hall was built by Ed's
				 brother Al Schieffelin. </p>				
			</div>
			<h2><a href="#">The Earp's</a></h2>
			<div>
				<p>The Earp family are known as the saviors of Tombstone, as many people of the town say that their famous shootout kept Tombstone alive for all the booming years. Wyatt Earp was the deputy sheriff Pima County, Arizona which includes Tombstone.
				He moved to Tombstone in December 1879 along with his brothers Virgil and Morgan. Proir to the famous gunfight on Fremont Street, also known as the gunfight at the OK Corral, the Earps had a history with some local cowboys; Ike Clanton, Billy Claiborne,
				 and few of their men. These men had been threatening to kill the Earps for weeks and Marshal Earp, the newly elected city Marshal, heard they were armed and gathered near the OK Corral. The three Earp brothers 
				 met the cowboys on Fremont Street and in 24 seconds the three brothers eliminated the threat.
