		<h2>The Famous Silver Mines</h2>
		<div>
			<p style="text-align: center;">Silver was discovered in southern Arizona as early as 1858. During the beginning of Eds prospecting, he used an existing mine as a base to being his search called the San Pedro
			Mine. The abandoned camp was the site of 22 murders before Ed had arrived to prospect as the area is only 12 miles from hostile Apache camps. After finally locating float ore, it took him many more months
			to find the source. The vein was estimater to be 50 feet long and 12 inches wide. This news spread quickly throughout the Eastern US, which sparked a silver strike and growth of Tombstone plus 6 sister towns
			nearby. As the thousands of prospectors mined the San Pedro River, they eventually hit water at 520 ft below the surface, which flooded the mines. The solution was to pump water to surface tanks and utilize the water.
			This allowed them to continue to mine for a few more years, but eventually the mines flooded and ended the ability to mine silver ore. By 1930, Tombstone's population dropped to 150 people.</p>
