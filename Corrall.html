<h2>A Little Back Story</h2>
	<p>The OK Corral was a horse corral built in 1879 in Tombstone Arizona. The corral has been made famous from the film "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral". The gunfight did not actually take place inside the corral but in the 
	vacant lot nearby called Fremont Street.<br> In the gunfight, some the shooters were only 6 feet away from each other. Ike Clanton, the only surviving member of the Clanton family, he did not have a weapon
	and ran before the shooting started, to fight the Earps and Holliday. Ike filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday that were later dismissed and their actions found lawful.<br> The verdict did not end the fight however, Virgil Earp was ambushed by the 
	two surviving cowboys. Only 5 months later their brother Morgan was shot and killed in an alley by an unknown gunman, suspected by Wyatt to be Frank Stilwell. 4 months after Morgan was murderd, Wyatt later admitted in his old years, Wyatt
	killed Stilwell with a point blank shotgun blast.<br> Thus struck the amazing back story to the gun fight recreation, performed inside the corral.
