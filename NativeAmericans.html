		<h2>Chiricahua Apache Indians</h2>
			<p>--The Chiricahua Apache Indians have inhabited southern Arizona and New Mexico as early as the 1850s with a population of around 1300- 1500. Chief Cochise was the leader of the Chiricahua Apaches in southern Arizona.<br>
			--Their population was scattered in small groups over a large area covereing two states, Arizona and New Mexico.<br>--The tribes survived by hunting game, gathering edible plants, & growing small amounts of their own food. The tribes would migrate depending on availability of 
			food and other resources. <br>--In early times, the Indians fought amongst each other until around 1854 when the US military brought forces to their area to start scouting parties. The raiding parties changed from each other to 
			the Americans.<br>This battle took place over the next 30 years until 1886 when Geronimo, a native medicine man turned chief, surrendered to General Crook with a small band of warriors. Their numbers had 
			dwindled down to a mere 600 by 1862<br>--With their surrender, the Chiricahua were eventually forced to live in Florida, Alabama, and Oklahoma. In 1913, 130 Chiricahua were allowed to move onto a reservation in New Mexico.</p>
